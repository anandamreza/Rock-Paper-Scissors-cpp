# Rock-Paper-Scissors-cpp
A simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game written in C++. The program runs in the console and allows the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then compares it against the computer’s randomly generated choice.

## **Features**



* Validated player input (must be a single character: `R`, `P`, or `S`)
* Randomized computer choice using `rand()`
* Clear win/lose/draw result logic
* Replay option (`Y/N`)
* Clean and readable console output

This project serves as practice for basic C++ concepts such as input handling, control flow, functions, and simple randomization.
